      "title": "TEDx MiltonAcademy Amplifies Student Voices",
      "author": "Dilan Payne '27 News Writer",
      "text": "On December 12, Milton Academy's Thacher Room welcomed a line up of five speakers as TEDxMilton Academy hosted another evening of student-led talks. The TEDx event, featuring five speakers-including four students aimed to spark deep discussions and meaningful connections among the community, all while addressing topics ranging from healthcare inequity to the neurological power of music. TEDX, a initiative created to fulfill TED's overall mission to research and discover \"ideas worth spreading,\" brings the spirit of TED to local communities around the globe. TEDx hosts over 3000 events annually. Rhia Patel 26, one of the speakers, has advocated for menstrual equity since middle school, working with local student-led coalitions that inspired her to investigate public health issues impacting young girls. Spreading her knowledge to the greater Milton community, Rhia drew upon her advocacy work with Free Period Talk, an interscholastic coalition, in her speech. Yet, Patel noted that \"TEDx is really different from what I have previously done with student-led advocacy.\" Patel planned to discuss grassroots \"the educational aspect as well as my own story with menstrual advocacy, rather than others' stories.\" When first applying to Milton, Patel learned about the 2022 TEDx event while reading through the talks. \"I thought it was really cool that students can have the opportunity to share their experiences and things that matter to them,\" she stated. Yet she hesitated, unsure of her ability to follow in those students' footsteps. After applying with a one-page outline of her speech and low expectations, Patel was accepted by the co-heads of TEDx to speak on women's and girls' healthcare and education. Stepping outside of Milton's critical writing style, Patel instead approached her passion with a deeply personal and reflective lens, utilizing the TEDx platform to share her journey through advocacy and call the greater community to action. Hoping her speech will \"have a positive impact,\" Patel aimed to spark dialogue around girls' healthcare education. \"I hope people will recognize that there are certain issues, especially in girls' healthcare education, that are not new, but rather, ignored.\" For Devan Agrawal '25, TEDx provides a platform to connect his personal experiences with Alzheimer's Disease to music, exploring the intersection of the two and the ways in which music is a powerful tool for memory and healing. In his talk, \"Echoes of a Melody: Music's Power to Treat Alzheimer's Disease,\" Agrawal planned to share how music allowed his grandmother to reconnect with memories lost to Alzheimer's. Music \"acts as a universal language for humanity,\" he explained. \"It's hard wired into our DNA.\" Blending personal anecdotes with scientific insight, Agrawal illustrated music's power not only to rekindle forgotten memories but also to serve as a preventative tool against cognitive decline. Urging audience members to \"consider creating a soundtrack for [their] lives,\" Agrawal hoped to help others preserve important memories while fostering connections to family and friends. Additional speakers included Ryan Farokhzad 25, who presented on innovative disease therapies; Simon Farruqui '25, who delved into computational politics; and Spanish teacher Marisela Funes, who shared her reflections on living \"in the in-between.\" Each talk promised to blend research and personal experience, remaining true to the TEDx spirit of sparking discussion and connection. Some speeches had the intention not only of informing but also of inspiring action. Patel, for instance, hoped her talk resonated with young girls in the audience. \"I want them to feel like they don't have to be ashamed to talk about menstruation, and that they can do anything in the world- no one should tell them they can't.\" She hoped her speech would encourage her audience not only to recognize systemic inequities but also to respond to them. Agrawal echoed similar sentiments, hoping his talk will \"encourage people to see music's power in a new light.\" As a roaring final applause filled the Thacher Room, TEDxMiltonAcademy hoped to remind its audience of the transformative power of sharing stories. Whether through Patel's call for menstrual education and equality or Agrawal's harmonious blend of memory and music, the event, following TEDx's mission, aimed to ignite curiosity, foster connection, and inspire action, while attempting to prove that often, the most profound change can begin with a single voice. Editor's Note: This story was written and edited before the event on Thursday evening."

      "title": "Quiz Bowl Team Qualifies for WGBH Quiz Show",
      "author": "Tiffany Jin '28 News Writer",
      "text": "On Sunday, November 17, the Quiz Bowl Team achieved a significant milestone by qualifying for the WGBH High School Quiz Show. Now in its sixteenth season, the show is an award-winning single-elimination academic team competition for Massachusetts high school students. Milton secured one of the two wildcards, reserved for the two highest-ranked teams that haven't participated in the past five years and did not qualify with one of the fifteen highest scores. The team will now face Deerfield Academy in the season's first televised episode, competing for the sixteenth and final position on the official tournament bracket. The episode will feature four rounds of gameplay-Toss-Up, Head-to-Head, Category, and Lightning-and is set to film on January 25. It will be uploaded on the High School Quiz Show YouTube channel on February 8. If the team progresses, more episodes will be filmed on February 2, and they will air gradually. The Milton team, composed of four primary team members and two alternates, was formed after consideration of club attendance and seniority. Primary team members are Eli Berk '26, Alex Sherman '27, Simon Picotte 25, and Nam Nguyen '25. Alternates are Rhys Adams 26 and Solomon Fleiss 28. Fleiss shared his motivation for joining: \"I have always had an interest in random facts and trivia, and the Quiz Bowl seemed like the perfect place to execute these passions.\" Captains Berk and Picotte initially struggled to navigate the club application process and secure faculty permission last year. Ultimately, the group moved forward as a \"team\" rather than a \"club.\" Although their first year of competition ended without qualification, the experience proved valuable. This year, the team began meeting every week since the start of school. Practices were structured to sharpen their knowledge in key categories, including Math, Science, History, Geography, Literature, The Arts, Current Events, Civics, Sports, and Pop Culture. \"At first, I was unsure of what we were going to do as alternates,\" Fleiss admitted, \"but it's actually very engaging to be an alternate-they still let you run through all the questions.\" The qualification test consisted of five questions in each of the ten categories above to be answered in 45 minutes as a team. \"The time [wasn't] really a pressure,\" Berk explained. \"The thing with Quiz Bowl is either you know it or you don't. There were no deductions for wrong answers so sometimes we just had to make up a guess and hope it's right.\" Having participated in last year's qualification process, Picotte noted that the team felt more prepared this time around. However, confidence wavered after the test, \"Walking out, I remember not feeling too confident\" Berk recalled. Fleiss added, \"[Qualifying] was such exciting news, it was really an unexpected surprise to all of us.\" Librarian Beth Reardon, who has prior experience coaching Quiz Bowl and was once a contestant on Jeopardy!, offered unique insights into the value of such competitions. \"It's a really different activity\" she explained. \"It's fun to execute the knowledge you've gained in the classroom which might not be used in your everyday life. Stepping outside your box and going on TV is a big deal. [When I was on Jeopardy], the lights and TV cameras were intimidating, but I kept thinking, I could win this whole thing.\" Science teacher Joanna Latham, the faculty sponsor of the team, expressed her pride in the captains' efforts. \"[Qualifying was] so exciting! Eli and Simon had this vision, passion, and excitement... They've come so far from the initial kernel of an idea.\" Looking ahead, Berk and Picotte hope to expand and formalize the team for the future years. \"We really think that there are a lot of talented people at Milton who would be really good at [Quiz Bowl],\" Picotte said, \"We encourage everyone to give it a try. The more people that are excited about Quiz Bowl, the more competitive our team can be.\" Latham echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the high-stakes experience of being in a competition like this that's televised is so valuable. Being able to dig into something, pursue it with passion, and then just take it to this next level is where the fun comes from.\""

      "title": "Winter Assembly Ditches \"Religious Undertones,\" Rebrands to \"Community\"",
      "author": "Raphael Rufino '27 A&E Writer",
      "text": "The Winter assembly on Thursday, December 19th, 2024 will host multiple performances, including high school Orchestra and Jazz groups, middle school Glee Club, and the highly anticipated third grade and senior year \"lifer\" Collaborative Song. The staple performance returns this year-however, it will look different. The previous song, \"Children, GO Where I Send Thee,\" by Kenny Rogers contained many Christmas connotations, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. It highlights key biblical figures and events, such as the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, Paul and Silas' missionary work, and the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. Due to these references, the administration removed the song, along with every other religious song historically performed at the assembly. Manager of Events Cory Butler explains, \"We're focusing on community building.\" She and Head of School Alixe Callen understand that religious songs signify an important part of the school's past. However, the administration is trying to steer the Winter Assembly away from the religious undertones which the Rogers song reflects. Instead, Butler is introducing a new plan, saying that she \"[emailed] the lifers at the beginning of September; [these students] will now be choosing their own song, and get to pick what represents that moment for. This year, the third graders and lifers will sing \"We Are Going To Be Friends,\" by the White Stripes. Each year, boarders celebrate the holiday season by caroling around campus, visiting each dorm to spread holiday cheer and sing traditional Christmas carols. However, the removal of \"Children, Go Where I Send Thee\" from the Winter Assembly spraked frustration with lifers such as Max Donovan 25, Amelia Stenta '25, and Tatum Schoettle '26. Donovan shared his disappointment, stating, \"it's unfair how the boarders are able to sing Christmas carols to each other, while the lifers are prohibited from similar holiday festivities.\" Donovan also noted his family's discontent with the change: \"my parents, having invested so much in the Milton community over the years, were extremely disappointed to hear that neither my brother nor I would be able to participate in the Milton holiday tradition.\" Jessie Ward 25 and Rowan Cain 25 believe the decision to remove the song should have been put to a vote by the student body and other community members attending the assembly. Along with the \"lifer\" song, the winter assembly contains various performances including, the Orchestra, led by Music Department Chair Adrian Anantawan, which plans on performing pieces by Duke Ellington, a 1950's Jazz Composer, and a piece called \"New World Symphony,\" composed by 19th Century Bohemian composer Antonín Dvořák. Cello player and orchestra participant, Chisom Unamka 27 \"find[s] it interesting why an orchestra is playing a jazz piece,\" expressing her fondness for another Dvořák piece, stating that \"it's one of [their] favorites.\" Along with the orchestra, jazz groups led by Jazz Teacher Jared Sims also plan on performing. Rowan Collins '27, an avid electric guitarist states, \"We are playing Alligator Bogaloo by Lou Donaldson.\" Jazz Drummer Theo Goldberg '27 explains, \"We're doing three songs. One is a funk blues tune.\" Because the assembly is K-12, the lower and middle divisions will also have a variety of performances. Music Teacher Ted Whalen explains, \"there are some lower school singers: the third grade, lower school chorus, and... middle school chorus also performing.\" Along with these performances, Milton's own lower school step team, Little Steppers, led by Lower School Dean of Teaching and Learning Joanne Brown and Lower School Learning Specialist Kim Alston, will make their debut. Although the performances attract the audience's attention, the MCs bring a smoother and more polished transition to the assembly. Middle School Digital Media and Film and Middle School Speech Coach Yoshi Makishima wrote the script for the Middle School MCs. While the assembly historically mainly focused on the holidays, Maksishma explains the new direction, \"We are clearly trying to be more inclusive, trying to move away from the assumption that everyone who attends this institution is coming from a Christian background.\" She adds, \"The people who are part of our Milton community extend much broader beyond that.\" While writing the script, Makishima shares her goals, \"to not mention red and green, to not mention Santa, but also do mention togetherness, do mention hope, do mention the idea of light and dark.\""

      "title": "How to Talk to Your Senior Friends About College",
      "author": "Rebekah M Fabella '25, Onur Gurol '25, Emily Ma '25, James McEvoy '25, Char Mone '25",
      "text": "Enter the fateful malaise of mid-December stroll through the top of the Stu and see seniors crowded around computers, frantically checking for news. The tension is nearly tangible, though we can certainly celebrate and support the seniors in our lives. While it can be exciting to learn about your friends' future aspirations and plans, we, as Senior Editors, want to introduce you to some different personalities you might encounter in the senior class: i) The Apathetic; ii) The Pessimist; iii) The Optimist; iv) The Arrogant; v) The Superstitious. We call the first of our characters the Apathetic because they claim to \"not care\" about college results. When you ask your senior friends, \"How're you feeling as your decisions are soon going to be rolling out?\" and they sidestep the conversation or claim that they don't really care, you might guess that they represent the Apathetic applicant at that moment. In the slurry of emotions conjured by the college process, students often resort to apathy as a means of avoiding difficult feelings and thoughts. When you observe this behavior in your friends, reassure them that the spectrum of their feelings good, bad, and everything in between is genuine and often more beneficial to express than repress. Next, we have our \"Negative Nancy\" of the group or, as we dub them, the Pessimist. These students have convinced themselves that they will be denied from their top colleges, most likely in an effort to dull the sting of rejection. As said by Zendaya in Spiderman: No Way Home, \"expect disappointment and you'll never be disappointed.\" While we might be able to understand the appeal of this method, this pessimism is likely a front. So, although it may seem impossible to reassure the Pessimist, just know that they, too, are dealing with the universal hope and anxiety of many other seniors. Now, be extra cautious with this next specimen, as too much motivation could lead to hazardous confidence and too little could result in a harsh faceplant of reality. The Arrogant approaches college conversations with a unique eagerness and certainty that they will get into their colleges, particularly their first choices (or, the schools their parents donated a building to). While this confidence would otherwise be a good trait while navigating the uncertainty of the process, it can get out of hand when it starts to discourage others and consumes their life. An important distinction from the Arrogant is the rarer, but more refreshing Optimist. Optimists do not necessarily think that they will get into the colleges they applied to, but rather hold on to the hope that everything will ultimately work out or \"everything happens for a reason.\" They possess a healthy level of confidence that their effort will take them in the right direction. While this friend may not need as much reassurance (or therapy) as other applicants, your support and encouragement will always be appreciated. Here struts the Superstitious applicant. Oh, how stressed they look, longing for control beyond their reach. Whilst venturing down a rabbit hole of everything that could go disastrously wrong - like the possibility that their admissions officer is hangry while reading their application - they are busy searching for angel numbers and ladybugs. This student wants to get into their prospective school so deeply that they are looking for any way to ensure a positive outcome. Even though your Superstitious friend may seem delusional or crazy in their methods, attempt to understand why their coping mechanisms might support them in this frenzied time. Allow them to feel like they have this sliver of control. While we have provided you with simple, face-value definitions, it is more likely that most seniors will be a mix of all of these characters throughout the college process. Shifts in emotions and feelings are normal. So, as a friend of a senior who is going through the process, you do not know where everyone will be at a given moment, but you also do not need to know! Be supportive, but not delusional. Be positive, but not unrealistically so. Definitely don't try to convince them that the whole process is a hopeless hoax, but acknowledge why you, and your senior friends may begin to believe it to be. Beneath the range of wildly different pre-decision facades lies a communal lack of control. Seniors have put years of work into their clubs, classes, and sports, and yet, are awarded minutes of an admission officer's time. As our efforts in highschool are so intrinsically tied to who we are, and the things that we love, the possibility of a college rejection can begin to feel like a rejection of our person. Non-seniors, you have seen these students in their zones, seen them become leaders, and it can be confusing to see those that you look up to begin to doubt themselves. So how do you reassure your friends, when you too are not sure of their outcomes? You've gotten to know them beyond the confinements of a 7-page application. Keep treating them like you always have-as a friend, not just an applicant."

      "author": "Teresa Li '26 News Writer",
      "text": "Each year on the day before everyone departs for winter break-December 18 this year the administration hosts a dinner for all boarders to gather, celebrate, and enjoy some good food. David Lee '25, one of the boarding monitors, explains, \"Boarder Dinner involves a ton of collaboration with not just the students but also various Milton staff members [including the administration and Aramark].\" Much like previous years, this year's Boarder Dinner will include \"opening speeches from the boarding monitors, Ms. Stone, and Dr. Callen; a cappella performances; and then a buffet-style meal.\" All four cappella groups (EP!C, Resonate, Miltones, and Octet) will be performing at the event. For example, Resonate will be singing \"Greedy\" by Ariana Grande because \"they wanted a more upbeat song to suit Boarder Dinner,\" according to Resonate member Anders Yu '28. On the other hand, Miltones and EPIC decided to go down a more traditional route, choosing to contribute to the festive spirit by performing \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" by Mariah Carey. An event that has existed for decades, Boarder Dinner is welcomed with many positive anticipations from students. \"I like that the entire boarding community comes together for the event, and I enjoy the performances as well,\" said Elizabeth Sim 27. Agreeing with Sim, Lee said that he \"think[s] Boarder Dinner is a fantastic bonding opportunity for the boarding community [and] it's a wonderful way to transition into Winter Break, [serving] as a good celebration of the halfway point to our year.\" On the other hand, Valerie Gu 25 enjoys Boarder Dinner because she \"likes getting to dress formal with [her] friends and also being able to connect with the entire boarding community.\" Similarly, Yu, who is a day student, views Boarder Dinner as a great opportunity to strengthen bonds with the people in your dorm but also to see other people from other dorms too.\" Speaking particularly for this year's Boarder Dinner, Lee revealed that the \"menu is, in my opinion, the best we've had since I was a new student.\" However, in contrast to Gu's support of formal dressing, Sim thinks that the formality impedes success since \"it [will be] cold, and a lot of us [will] have flights to catch.\" Therefore, she stated that \"dressing up for the occasion will only make a lot of us colder and more burdened.\" Furthermore, Sim claimed that \"Boarder Dinner shouldn't be mandatory for students who need to catch a flight that night\" given the busy time for travelling. Gu noted that Boarder Dinner \"could have better food\" and \"should not be taking place in the RSG.\" Rather, she suggested holding the event \"in the ACC or [Goodwin] Room in Ware.\" Sim believes the purpose of boarder dinner is \"to bring the boarding community together and let us celebrate Christmas together since a lot of us don't have the chance to celebrate with family.\" Yu concluded that \"Boarder Dinner is an amazing way for boarders from different houses to connect.\" Gu echoed this purpose of connection as well, claiming that it is \"well-fulfilled\" through this event. Conversely, although Sim encouraged having \"performances, [which] help fulfill the purpose [of Boarder Dinner] and bring a sense of togetherness to the community,\" she argued against the formality of the event as it \"separates the community.\""

      "title": "International Students Spend Break Studying, Wishing for More Time",
      "author": "Amy Khaing '27 News Writer",
      "text": "As Thanksgiving break began on November 23, international students navigated a mix of choices, one of which was the decision of whether to return home or stay close to Milton. Also, while most students reported taking time during the break to relax, almost half of the students surveyed reported spending some portion of the break studying. About half of international boarders surveyed went home during the break. Of the 25 international students who answered a TMM survey, representing approximately 20% of all international students, the majority shared the experience of taking time during the break to relax. Anthony Wu 27, a boarder from Hungary, \"hung out with friends.\" Yoyo Qiu '27 \"watched a lot of movies\" and \"went to a lot of good restaurants,\" while Amelia Joseph '28, a boarder from Saudi Arabia, \"met up with old friends\" and \"spent time with family.\" Still, 48% of the students surveyed spent time studying. For instance, though Tobias Kim '27 had \"some good Korean food\" and \"watched a lot of movies,\" he also \"worked on some Latin.\" Kailin Shi '25 \"considered staying in Boston,\" but ultimately decided to go back to Hong Kong to \"better focus on college.\" Personal circumstances like travel logistics, family plans, and affordability led to a wide range of travel experiences over the ten-day break. A majority of those who returned home expressed satisfaction with their relaxing time spent, while those who stayed voiced concerns about why they chose to remain in the U.S. Hong Kong 56% of the students surveyed returned home during Fall Break. Homesickness represented a leading influence for their travel. \"I miss the food and the culture,\" expressed Wu. Qiu decided to go home to China so she could \"meet her family.\" Kim, conversely, spent the break with his friend close to Milton. However, he \"didn't really check out the city\" and spent most of the \"time staying at the guest room.\" \"Around Thanksgiving and all the holidays in the U.S., flight prices go up... it's so hard to make plans without compromising class time,\" said Seline Shahzad 26. Jennifer Li 26 added that \"Thanksgiving, which is very specific to the US, doesn't coincide with a lot of my holidays back home [in Hong Kong], so even if I went back, my parents would be working and my friends would be at school.\" The 44% of international students surveyed who remained in the States shared some different experiences and opinions. Several international students criticized the break's length and timing. Andria Laitadze '26 thought that \"the break was too short to travel such a long distance [to Georgia , and Yurang Peng 28 agreed it was not \"worth international travel.\" Additionally, students from further countries like Mira Lu '27, from Hong Kong, didn't \"find it necessary to go back for Thanksgiving since she had to \"spend two days total traveling\" and \"adjust[ing] to jet lag.\" Similarly, fighting jet lag can take up to 3 days for Li: \"that's one third of my break spent sleeping through the day... not exactly a curse, but break is valuable time.\" Peng asked to \"make one of the breaks longer, like four weeks instead of... two.\" Darby Yang 27 thinks \"the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is kind of awkward.\" She also noticed that since \"the time between breaks is too short...teachers are cramming everything in.\" On the contrary, Qiu believes \"the [school] weeks in between [are] good\" since they \"[give] time to prepare for finals.\" Shi added that, above all, the fall break was well timed: \"It was really when I needed a break.\""

      "title": "January Exams Undermine Academic Intent and Mental Health",
      "author": "Solomon Fleiss '28 Opinion Writer",
      "text": "Heading into Thanksgiving break, I faced a mad dash of tests, papers, and lab reports. I returned with a turkey-filled stomach and with assessments planned in every academic subject in the week leading up to winter break. Now, looking ahead to 2025 and the official assessment week, I cannot help but ask: why are midterms in January? Teachers already plan two waves of assessments leading up to these holiday breaks. Wouldn't it make more sense for midterms to happen in December? Why do we have to go into break with a stressed mindset? That seems to undermine the objective of vacation. Currently, midterm exams are scheduled in the middle of the academic school year after Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Most classes have a two-hour assessment, and this year the final assessment is scheduled for Monday, January 27 with classes resuming on Friday, January 31. Students are given just enough time between the end of assessments and the start of the new semester to clean out their binders, get a haircut, and binge one season of their favorite Netflix series. The placement of exams in January is not the case at many similar, nearby academic institutions. For context, while Nobles, Roxbury Latin, and BB&N roughly begin and end their academic years on similar schedules to us in September and June, they have finals in December. In 2009, even Harvard switched to exams in December after 100 years on a January schedule. Exams are an integral piece of the Milton learning model. They allow students to prepare and show cumulative knowledge of a subject. January exams align well with semester-long classes; they also mirror the larger projects and papers that tend to dominate May. History teacher Michael Lou reflected on the schedule and structure: \"The process of of reviewing large amounts of material and writing with clarity is very important. January allows a little bit more information to be included. I like allowing students to use the winter break to do work if they want to. However, I can make it work for either one. It's just critical that students have the opportunity for this assessment structure once during the academic year.\" Like Lou, Upper School Principal Rachel Stone also expressed the importance of these assessments while also appearing in favor of their current timing: \"I haven't yet experienced midterms at Milton... Milton's approach of one set of cumulative assessments seems like a smart way to do exams. At my old school, I had everything from exams in March to December, and I actually had one year with January exams. While I understand the argument for December exams, it would be strange to end the semester in January if exams were in December. The whole semester would have to be reworked. Also by January, most Class I students have finished college applications and can focus on assessments.\" While I acknowledge these rationales, I think exams should be moved to December, as it would allow students to have a real vacation and come back rested and ready to learn. Our boarding community who travel across the globe to spend time with their families should be able to enjoy their families without the stress of exams looming over them. Milton intentionally gives students travel days and mandates no homework during time-off so that students can take vacation time to be with family and friends. Day students, too, want to spend time away and have a restful break! Looming exams negate this plan and create stress even if students don't spend the whole break studying (nor should they). William Lara McCannon '28 would prefer to have exams: \"in December, then you don't have to think about it over your break.\" Sasha Westphal '26 reflected, \"I don't really mind [exams], but I do wish they started later in the day so I could have time in the morning to sleep and prepare. Also, I would prefer finals in February, not right when we get back from break.\" A Harvard Business Review article in 2023 highlights the benefits of vacation on mental well being, cognitive ability and creativity: \"On a grander scale, taking time off provides an opportunity for big or innovative ideas to emerge. Lin-Manuel Miranda conceived of Hamilton while on vacation. 'It's no accident that the best idea I've ever had in my life perhaps maybe the best one I'll ever have in my life came to me on vacation, he shared.\" Three days off mid-week in January does not qualify as a Lin-Manuel-Miranda-style-creativity-generating refuel. The Milton community values and thrives on intellectual curiosity, creativity and continuous learning, and the school calendar should support us in this pursuit. A change in timing would not upend these values, but help promote them. Thus, I urge the school to consider shifting the exam schedule."

      "title": "We Must End Gender Bias in Athletics",
      "author": "Kaysia Maddix '26 Opinion Writer",
      "text": "We tend to not talk about the role gender plays in sports here at Milton. Despite the undeniable talent and dedication of female athletes, women's sports often lack the same level of attention, energy, and respect that their male counterparts enjoy. This disparity is evident not only amongst the student section, where the same support and school spirit that flourish during men's games are lacking during girls' games, but also amongst educators who subconsciously overlook the achievements and hard work of female athletes. Last year, when Boys' Varsity Basketball was competing against Exeter, the stands were jam-packed with people in the ACC dressed in all-black to show school spirit. When Milton won, the blur of the crowd dressed in all-black overtook the court. In contrast, Girls Varsity Basketball draws barely any crowds and has to struggle even for school funding. GVB athlete Leila Morton '25 expressed that she has seen inequity between the Girls' and Boys' Varsity Basketball teams such as \"girls having to pay $300 every year for a new tracksuit whilst the Boys' team are able to receive theirs for free.\" Morton also voiced that \"boys are able to get their uniform[s] washed periodically, while girls were never given that option.\" Tolu Adeyefa '25, Varsity Track and Field athlete and Girls Varsity Soccer team manager, expressed that even when Girls' and Boys' Soccer were travelling similar distances, the boys would receive a nicer ride such as a coach bus while the girls would receive Milton vans or school buses. Similarly to Morton, Adeyefa also mentioned that she hears that \"boys teams such as football, basketball, and soccer can get their jerseys washed on the loop,\" but she has \"never witnessed the girls' soccer team having that option.\" She questions why only the boys team needs to have their jerseys washed when they too have access to laundry machines in their dorm or at their house. Furthermore, there is a lack of appreciation on campus of female sports compared to their male counterparts. Edna Carlos Macuacua 25 shared that she believes \"male sports receive more appreciation by the staff not purposely but rather as [the staff is] following the status quo.\" This illustrates that the gender disparity in sports is far more complex than simply the numerical value of spectators filling the stands. This issue runs much deeper. This imbalance not only impacts the visibility and recognition of female athletes but also perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces a culture that often undervalues women's contributions to sports. Gender disparities at Milton shed light on the prevalent sexism that exists within the entire education system, affecting both students and teachers alike. The small but consequential inequities we see here call attention to the often unrecognized biases that lead to the undervaluing of the hard work and dedication that female athletes display. One must question: could this disparity stem from deeply ingrained societal norms that train us to view sports through a predominantly masculine lens? Why do male athletes consistently garner significantly more recognition and respect in comparison to their female counterparts? Male athletes are frequently perceived as more capable and their achievements are celebrated to a greater extent which creates a skewed narrative that elevates their status above that of female athletes. This belief not only diminishes the accomplishments of women in sports but also reinforces the harmful stereotypes about gender and athleticism. It's increasingly clear that we need to end these biases and advocate for greater equality in athletics to ensure that all athletes, regardless of their gender, are recognized for their talent and hard-earned success."

      "author": "Mike Gao '28 Opinion Writer",
      "text": "In a move that has sparked widespread debate and division, President Joe Biden decided to grant a pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, raising important questions about justice, fairness, and the integrity of our democratic institutions. How has President Biden justified this pardon, and what are the future implications of this decision? First, it is important to note that David Weiss, the special counsel who requested and was granted appointment in 2023 to lead the criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, was appointed to office by Donald Trump in 2018. This only adds to suspicions that align with President Joe Biden's statement that Hunter was \"singled out\" and that \"raw politics has infected this process.\" But it appears that Hunter Biden was convicted through legal channels he either was wrongfully prosecuted by a politically influenced justice system, or he was favored in a two-tiered justice system. This situation highlights the complexities and dangers of a justice system that seems to be influenced by political motivations, and it erodes public trust in government impartiality. The White House's statement included information about the full extent of the \"unconditional\" pardon, which included \"those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024.\" A staggering 11-year pardon for all committed crimes, this decision is detrimental, setting an easily exploitable precedent for future presidents, especially Donald Trump, who has granted numerous pardons to his close relatives and political allies. Due to the extent presidential pardons are allowed to assume, specious offenses such as but not limited to even treason could be pardoned. This is inherently wrong, as serious offenses to the country could be without consequences, even those that threaten the national security of the nation and put Americans at risk. Trump also announced in a December 8 interview that he will be looking to pardon January 6 rioters participating in the storming of the Capital, while also announcing on NBC television that \"everybody on that committee [investigating January 6], honestly, for what they did, should go to jail.\" The power to pardon can be exploited for political purposes. Regardless of his possible justifications for the pardon, President Biden is still biased due to his close personal connection to his son Hunter. Moreover, this pardon could reduce confidence in the President as Joe Biden went back on his words of not intervening in the decisions of the Department of Justice. This isn't just a legal decision; it's a political one that, whether intentionally or not, erodes public trust in the fairness of the justice system. This action from Biden sends out a dangerous message to the public that justice is not impartial and could be bent to protect the powerful. In 2023, polls conducted by the Pew Research Center found that \"looking to the future of the [political] system, about six-in-ten Americans (63%) say they have not too much or no confidence. A third say they have some confidence, and just 4% express a lot of confidence.\" Moreover, as of April 2024, \"22% of Americans say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right\"-most of the time, that is. Although public perception is not necessarily a decisive and accurate evaluation of our political system, it's clear that skepticism about its fairness and accountability is widespread. To ensure justice, limitations on presidential pardons should be implemented. Close relatives and close political allies should not be eligible for presidential pardons, yet that still raises the issue that the opposition would target them in attempts to reach political goals. This concern leads to the need for broader reforms to restore fairness in the justice system. One area of particular interest is the appointment of Supreme Court justices, which has become increasingly politicized. Presidents, including Donald Trump, have appointed justices who align with their political views. There must be clearer guidelines in place to ensure that the justice system is not distorted by personal connections or political calculations. While President Biden's decision to pardon his son may have been legally justified, its broader implications threaten the integrity of America's justice system. The power of pardons must be exercised with care and transparency, and limitations should be put in place to prevent future abuse; only through such reforms can confidence be restored and preserve the fairness of the government."

      "title": "Sleep Deprivation Is a Teen Crisis",
      "author": "Ryan Reddy '28 Opinion Writer",
      "text": "Amidst our extensive academic and athletic curriculum, sleep may be the least of our worries. Whether it's cramming for an exam the night before or working on a lab report due the next day, many Milton students have had to \"crunch\" assignments. Thus, for many, late nights have become the norm, with homework and screen time eating into precious hours that should instead be spent resting. Alarmingly, this practice is often celebrated as a sign of hard work and dedication to academics. However, these seemingly harmless habits define the silent epidemic that millions of teens face: sleep deprivation. Not getting enough sleep isn't just about feeling groggy or unfocused the next day. In actuality, the consequences can affect nearly every aspect of a student's life. Sleep is essential for memory consolidation. Without sleep, students may ironically struggle to retain the very information they stayed up late trying to learn. The National Library of Medicine, run by the United States government, emphasizes the severity of this issue, stating that \"subjects were tested after 35 hours of sleep deprivation; memory performance was approximately two letter grades (19%) worse when compared to the non-sleep-deprived subjects. This difference did not seem to be due to alertness.\" In essence, while students may sacrifice sleep for hopes of improving their academic outcomes, they often do the opposite by impairing their ability to absorb and recall information. The detrimental effects of sleep deprivation do not stop at memory. Chronic lack of sleep also affects decision-making and focus. A tired brain struggles to process information effectively, leading to slower reaction times and an increased likelihood of mistakes. This struggle can affect academic performance, extracurricular activities, and even basic daily tasks. Beyond academics, sleep is critical for emotional and physical regulation. Sleep-deprived students are more prone to mood swings, irritability, and anxiety; thus, they struggle with the already-stressful demands of high school. Studies from the National Library of Medicine have shown that lack of sleep amplifies emotional responses, making minor setbacks feel like insurmountable challenges. Long-term sleep deprivation is even more concerning; it increases the risk of serious health problems such as obesity, heart disease, weakened immunity, and even stunted growth. For teenagers who are still in a critical stage of growth and development, these risks are amplified. Despite the challenges of balancing a packed schedule, there are practical steps that students can take to prioritize sleep. But, we first need to identify the major causes of sleep deprivation. One major culprit is the excessive use of electronics. Smartphones, tablets, and laptops emit blue light, which suppresses melatonin production. The lack of melatonin makes it much harder to fall asleep. Students can combat this increased difficulty by setting strict limits on screen time, especially in the hour before bed. Another cause of lack of sleep is poor time management. If a teenager is expected to get adequate sleep and they procrastinate to the last minute, sufficient sleep is unobtainable. Planning ahead and breaking tasks into smaller chunks can prevent this dangerous last-minute cramming, reducing the need for late-night study sessions. And lastly, we can establish a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. A consistent sleep schedule helps regulate the body's internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up naturally. Ultimately, sleep deprivation is not a problem that should be ignored, especially in this high school environment. It is a hidden barrier to students' success, health, and happiness. By acknowledging its impact and by adopting better habits, students can reclaim the rest they need to thrive. Sleep is not a luxury-it's a necessity, and prioritizing it is one of the most important steps a high school student can take towards a healthier and more balanced life."

      "title": "Is Black Friday Treasure or Trap?",
      "author": "Zifu Song '27 A&E Writer",
      "text": "Thanksgiving is a time of gratitude, union, and joy. Families travel across the country, or even around the world, to gather in one living room and to celebrate this cherished holiday. At the same time, companies with renowned global brands pitch their Black Friday deals to consumers. These promotions often boast eye-catching discounts, sometimes so steep they seem almost too good to be true. While many shoppers take advantage of these sales and praise businesses for offering significant savings, others remain skeptical: do they exist to trick consumers into spending more money than they need to? Voices from sharp-eyed shoppers and vigilant members of the Milton community shed light on this debate. Milton students who participate in Thanksgiving shopping have strong opinions about Black Friday, recognizing that the sales often encourage consumers to buy items they might not usually consider. As Ben Wang 27 observes, for many name brands, Black Friday is a \"chance for [them] to sell past products so that they can get ready for the new year.\" Businesses would want to hold clearance sales for many different products: ones that have not sold well, models with less popular color schemes, or designs that are about to be discontinued. Most of the time, however, the main purpose of these sales is to clear the storage room of old stock to make room for new products. Ben also points out that not every item gets a discount, especially popular ones newly released. Still, for shoppers less concerned with trends or seeking classic items that don't change often, Black Friday can provide substantial savings. Profit is not the only driver behind Black Friday. The fact that these deals align with the Thanksgiving holiday suggests that they might be a way for brands to express their gratitude to their loyal customers. Considering that Black Friday is so close to Christmas, people can conveniently do all their holiday shopping under discounts. Dennis Zhou 27 aptly puts it: \"Thanksgiving gifts to add to the holiday spirit.\" Understanding the motivations behind \"shopping holidays\" is valuable, but mastering the art of holiday shopping is equally important. Getting the most out of these deals is simpler than it seems. Ben Wang 27 emphasizes that \"If you make the right decision during Black Friday, you can get a good discount.\" Jason Louie 25 believes that \"as consumers we also have responsibility to go about Black Friday rationally.\" Instead of buying impulsively and regretting those decisions, suggestions and strategies can be followed-the community provides some. Ethan Tsang 27, although not an avid shopper himself, observes that some people save their money throughout the year, and shop all their desired items during Black Friday. For those seeking a less extreme approach, Jason Louie 25 suggests that if there are less urgent purchases you have throughout the year, you can wait until Black Friday to realize that wish. For example, if he needs a winter coat in the fall, he notes the item but waits until Black Friday to buy it, maximizing savings. Wang also advises prioritizing quality over quantity. He recommends saving money to buy a high-end item at a decent discount. Buying less items prevents shoppers from drowning in the sea of receipts and reduces the risk of losing track of their realistic needs. In addition, the percentage of discounts for more expensive items are usually higher than cheap items, which may accumulate to more savings. The perspectives shared by my peers reflect the diverse attitudes toward Black Friday shopping. Some see it as an opportunity to snag great deals, while others approach it with caution, ensuring their purchases align with genuine needs. Personally, I believe that the true value of Black Friday lies in thoughtful planning-identifying what you truly need and staying disciplined. In the end, Black Friday can be both a trap and a treasure, depending on how we approach it. In the end, Black Friday is a complex tradition-a blend of corporate strategy, consumer behavior, and holiday spirit. For Milton students, it is not just about the deals; it is about learning how to shop wisely and responsibly. By planning purchases, staying focused on needs over wants, and taking advantage of the right deals, Black Friday can be a rewarding experience. Ultimately, the holiday season should remind us to reflect not only on what we buy but also on what truly matters: spending time with loved ones and expressing gratitude."

      "title": "Dr. Jared Sims Brings New Perspectives to Milton Jazz",
      "author": "Lyra Dvorin '28 A&E Writer",
      "text": "This year, Milton Academy welcomed Jazz teacher Jared Sims as the new Director of the Jazz Department. Prior to this change, the department had been led by one teacher, Bob Sinicrope, since its founding 52 years ago. Though such a transition might seem difficult, Sims commented that he knows Sinicrope personally, which has helped him during this period. The two have reportedly worked together and plan to present together at a conference in January. Sims stated that their \"philosophies about students and learning are very similar.\" Sims first came to Boston to attend college, completing his master's degree at New England Conservatory and his doctorate at Boston University. He began learning music with piano, but now primarily plays saxophone, as well as flute and other woodwind instruments. Sims still actively creates and performs music. He plans to release two albums soon and is preparing to record two more. Most of his music aligns with the genre of jazz while including additional elements. For example, one of his upcoming albums is an \"homage to great saxophone players that [he loves], but it's infused with Latin rhythms.\" In addition, he is booking a tour during March break, in which he will travel down the East Coast. Sims has been involved and interested in education since he was a high school student. He explained that for him, \"teaching and performance are very intertwined.\" He was drawn to teaching at Milton because, in his words, \"there are very few places in the entire world that have a jazz program like this.\" Sims currently teaches most of the Upper School jazz ensembles and a group of eighth-grade students. Instead of teaching purely theory, he noted that he teaches different concepts of jazz \"through performance,\" allowing students to get as much firsthand experience as possible. He described the class structure as a \"student-centered environment\" in which he focuses on the needs of each individual and allows them time to play their instrument rather than just \"[talking] at them.\" The jazz ensembles are each very small, and each student plays a specific role, leading to a \"unique team-building place.\" He remarked that the class changes entirely if even one student is absent, marking just how important every musician is. Though Sims has worked with students of many ages and experience levels, he noted that what sets high schools apart is \"everybody's coming in with fresh ears,\" ready to experience whatever the class has to offer. He added that \"the achievements of the students here are beyond their years.\" The classes also have a diverse instrumental makeup, presenting different obstacles and opportunities. \"Every instrument has its own unique challenges,\" Sims explained. \"Sometimes in the classroom, something that might be easy for a guitarist might be more challenging for a trumpet or piano player...Challenges come in different forms for everybody.\" Recently, on November 19 and 21, the jazz ensembles performed in King Theater. However, rather than merely concerts, these showcases can be seen as a \"celebration of all the learning [they've] done,\" according to Sims. When describing the concerts, he noted that \"every single jazz student was featured,\" setting the performances apart from what many others. The songs gave each musician an opportunity to shine and display their skills. Playing jazz requires a \"good knowledge of the music,\" Sims said. Each student and ensemble interprets the music in a unique way, which occurs in what Sims described as an \"organic fashion in the classroom.\" The jazz ensembles are an impressive and integral part of the music program, and Sims is a core aspect of these classes. As a new teacher, he brings years of experience and a fresh perspective to the Jazz Department. Perhaps most importantly, these classes are \"enjoyable, and something to look forward to,\" according to Brady Payne '25. The jazz student claims that the class is \"his favorite part of the day.\" Sims summarized, \"We do some really serious work here, but everybody has such a good time.\""

      "title": "Wicked Defies Both Gravity and Expectations",
      "author": "Sissi Ma '26 A&E Writer",
      "text": "On November 22, the long-awaited Wicked movie premiered in theaters around the country. Wicked, directed by John Chu, stars Ariana Grande as Glinda, the good witch of Oz, and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, a green skinned girl ostracized for her differences who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Set in Shiz University, a place where Ozians come to learn magic, Glinda arrives exorbitantly decked in pink, excited to lead the class; Elphaba is there just to drop off her younger sister, Nessa Rose (Marissa Bode). But, soon Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) notices something about Elphaba beyond just her skin color: Elphaba has powers-she's a witch. Morrible enrolls Elphaba at Shiz, where the witch eventually becomes Glinda's roommate and friend. From there on, the dynamic duo continues its magical saga. Many are familiar with Wicked. Tens of thousands of children and others have watched the beloved show on Broadway as well as seen the iconic 1939 The Wizard of Oz, the classic that inspired the Broadway hit. So many generations have been enthralled by the musical story about the origins of the not-so-bad Wicked Witch of the West. Kids and grown ups alike, including myself, have been humming classics like \"Popular\" and \"Defying Gravity for more than two decades. Thus, while the film adaptation will give so many more people the opportunity to fall in love with the green-skinned girl for the first time, the existing expectations, stemming from nostalgia and Broadway standards, are huge. In terms of online ratings, expectations were fulfilled. On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie has a 96% on the Popcornmeter from over 10,000 verified audiences. The movie has also been Certified Fresh, with an 89% score on the Tomatometer by the critics. Similarly, it was rated an 8.2/10 on the IMDb site from over 25,000 ratings and reviews, and has climbed as the second most popular movie on IMDb Charts. In fact, the box office numbers also completely blew up, passing the $450 million global mark just this week. Echoing Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, many Milton students thoroughly enjoyed the film. Rhys Adams 26 stated that he, \"[as a musical theater super fan], loved the movie... it was [also] much better than Cats, The Prom, and Into the Woods\" (Adams listed other movie adaptations of musicals). Anna Subratie '26 agreed, describing it as \"good,\" and Alisha Xu 27 concurred with both Adams and Subratie, commenting that she \"liked the portrayal of the characters and the songs.\" Yet, with apologies to Glinda, Wicked's reception wasn't just pink, sparkle, and ponies: some viewers were disappointed. This included Times Magazine reviewer Stephanie Zacharek, Zacl who described the multitudes of plot points as \"like a traffic pileup of flying monkeys\" and the settings as \"so lavish to the point where your ears and eyeballs wished [they would stop.\" Both Subratie and Xu thought \"the internet and social media over-promoted it.\" Xu specified that when she was in the theater she \"kept wanting more while Subratie was \"a little disappointed that Tik Tok spoiled a lot of the scenes and the songs.\" The movie's having a \"Part $2\"$ -meaning the two hours and 40 minutes viewers spend watching is only half of the story-also irked some viewers. Xu was surprised, noting that \"I didn't think there [would be] a second part... I just expected to watch the whole thing in the theaters.\" Subratie \"was also a little disappointed that [she has] to wait a year to see Act Two.\" While there were a few areas for improvement, a truly standout performance was Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba. Zacharek noted that Erivo was \"the only force that didn't make me feel ground down to a nub... she channels real pain rather than just show-time self-pity.\" And yes, people did feel for her. \"Cynthia Erivo is a vocal powerhouse,\" Adams pointed out. Subratie also exclaimed, \"I thought Erivo did super well.\" Ultimately, Wicked not only defied gravity-it also defied expectations. Many audiences left the theater beyond satisfied. And in any case, the movie has ensured that, for the foreseeable future, the hit Broadway songs many grew up with will live on, as kids, teens, and adults alike find, somehow-through the flying monkeys, green cities, and magical school-a tale of friendship and acceptance... and impossible high notes."

      "title": "Is \"Modern\" Art Still Art?",
      "author": "Adrienne Webb '26 A&E Writer",
      "text": "What is art? Some say that art can be anything and found anywhere, which I too agree with. However, as the perception of art evolves, debates arise on how far the boundaries of art can stretch. The “Comedian” is a piece made by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan featuring a basic banana duct taped to a wall. Originally sold at Art Basel Miami Beach fair in 2019, two editions of the piece sold for $120 thousand, and the third sold for an undisclosed price. During its showing, performance artist David Datuna grabbed the banana and ate it as an extension of the artistry rather than an act of vandalism. This action leads to the most absurd aspect of this work: the banana’s change. Even if the artist originally used an exotic banana with sentimental value, the banana's tendency to rot requires its frequent replacement. Typically, an artwork worth 7 figures is a preserved original, yet the object’s changing for each showing and auction leads to its title: “Comedian.” Cattelan did not intend for this piece to be satire, but rather, “a reflection on what we value.” I suppose that, in this case, one could interpret him as mocking the value placed on modern-day “art” that has no true meaning. Perhaps he means to criticize the refusal to value unconventional art work. Nonetheless, the third buyer of the “Comedian” later donated it to The Guggenheim Museum in New York. Here, this edition auctioned for $6.24 million. The buyer, Justin Sun, is the executive for a cryptocurrency platform and believes that the piece “represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community [and] will inspire more thought and discussion in the future and will become a part of history.” After winning the auction, he was given one banana and a piece of duct tape with an official certificate for installing the work. However, he did not install it at all, instead eating the banana. Events like these genuinely challenge the way we value and perceive art, and ask whether some art issimply a waste of money. Given the piece’s title, the “Comedian,” it may seem ironic to spend such an egregious amount of money to eat an unoriginal banana. Phoebe Zhang ‘26, believes the real question is how you price art: “if the person believes that the banana is worth that much money for whatever reason then sure, but there are better things that people in general should care about and spend their money on.” Another art student, Ify Umerah ’25 finds that the whole concept is “oxymoronic” and doesn’t see the point in such a display of wastefulness. Drawing and painting student Jennifer Li ’26 stated that she ‘‘holds a very deep appreciation for technically impressive art,’’ claiming to be disheartened by the banana’s being eaten. ‘‘Maybe I just don’t get it,’’ Li stated. While she finds modern art pretentious, she ‘‘understands the need to resort to absurdity when trying to produce novelty.’’ As more and more artistic ideas are repeated, it is natural for artists to begin creating simplistic works and slap on an arbitrary meaning, especially if it sells. Seline Shahzad ’26, a performing arts student, notes that ‘‘$6.24 million is a lot of money which could be going toward a number of positive causes. For someone with a scope of influence as great as Sun's to spend this amount on a banana is absurd. Of course, each person should be able to choose what to do with their money, I just find this choice to be disheartening when it comes to the way the affluent use their platforms.’’ Whether this piece has changed art history for better or for worse is up for interpretation. So, would you spend 7 figures on a banana?"

      "title": "Students Directors Aim to Provoke Thought Through Humor",
      "author": "Mira Lu '27 A&E Writer",
      "text": "On January 16 and 17, the Performing Arts department will present The Student-Directed One Acts. The four directors are David Lee ‘25, Phoebe Zhang ‘26, Seline Shahzad ‘26 and Finn Chen ‘26. This year, the four 15-minute plays range across themes of comedy, morality, and love. Shahzad explained that to apply as directors students filled out a form “describing a chosen theatrical piece and why [they] wanted to direct it.” Performing arts teacher Shane Fuller decided which students would direct. The directors held auditions on November 15. Each play had a specified cast size ranging from two to six characters. Zhang found that picking her cast of four to be a tough decision, noting that there was “a lot of talent” and she had “a lot of people who [she thought] really suited [her] roles.” The students also received audition sheets to indicate their availability during the week so that each cast could find suitable times to rehearse. Shahzad will be directing “21 Chump Street,” by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The 14-minute musical is based on the true story of 18-year-old Justin Laboy, a former honors High School student arrested for selling drugs to an undercover police officer. The play, inspired by Robbie Brown's ''What I Did for Love,'' explores the themes of love, responsibility, and deceit within the setting of a high school. The cast consists of Copper Jones ‘25, Bea Becker ‘25, Marlo Tranch ‘28, Lyra Dvorin ‘28, and Josie Koulomzin ‘28, and Ann Foster. Shahzad described that the short play explores serious topics relevant to high school students while retaining the fun nature of musical theatre. By presenting grave themes in a light-hearted manner (through catchy songs), Shahzad aims to create art that can “make others reflect on what they know and develop a nuanced view of the world, so putting on an enjoyable and thought-provoking show means a lot to [her].” Although this is Shahzad’s first time taking on the role of a sole director for a whole show, she brings ample theatrical experience, having been in 7 Milton productions and co-directed fellow classmates in her Advanced Theatre Studies class. In addition to working with the actors, Shahzad hopes to explore the technical aspects of theatre: “I’m looking forward to learning how to navigate the light and sound boards for the performances.” Lee will be directing “Time Flies” by David Ives, which depicts two mayflies who meet and quickly develop a romantic bond with one another, eventually realizing how short their lives are when going on a date. Lee, who directed “Sure Thing” last year, another one of David Ives’ works, describes the playwright as having “a goldmine of incredible one-act comedies.” His cast consists of Julie Atkeson ‘25, Nikita Baruah ‘27, and Guthrie Meyer ‘25. “I ventured back into Ives’ works to decide what else I would want to try directing. I fell in love with “Time Flies” the moment I read its premise,” Lee stated. He is confident the play will turn out successfully.” “Time Flies” has it all: an immense potential for physical comedy, a stunningly dark but unserious tone, and a premise that can attract an audience on its own.” First-time director Zhang chose “The Game” by Louise Bryant, a short example of an English Morality Play. The play centers around four characters: Death (Davey Glazer ‘28), Life (Caira Rahim ‘28), Girl (Liz Harris ‘28) and Youth (Yoyo Qiu ‘27). The story, which sees Life and Death play a dice game to decide the fate of a dancer and a poet, explores themes of true love, peace, and the pursuit of hope. Given the play’s captivating allegorical nature that opens up possibilities for imaginative storytelling, Zhang hopes to experiment with different visions of the story through various artistic expressions, set designs, lighting decisions, and costume styles. “By choosing this play, I get a chance to find a unique portrayal of an empowering tale,” she explains. Zhang is looking to have a simple set with a little dance in her play. One rehearsal in, Zhang envisions a successful play that will match her expectations. “We’re going to have a lot of movement in our play to really show the dynamics between the characters.” Chen ‘26 will be directing “Lush Life” by Nina Shengold. The play is set during a late night on a subway platform, where a single woman Sarah Zettler (Aava Darvish ‘27) runs into a homeless and disoriented street jazz musician Jimmy (Victoria Kirkham ‘26), who may or may not be her first love. Led by these directors, the casts will come together to rehearse and fine-tune the show after Winter Break in preparation for its production."

      "title": "No Snow? No Problem: Varsity Skiing Excels Off the Slopes",
      "author": "Avaneesh Siruvuri ‘26 Sports Writer",
      "text": "What makes a ski team without snow? For Varsity Skiing, that question is not merely hypothetical: for most skiing practices until mid-January, the slopes at Blue Hills are bare. In the face of warmer winters, Varsity Skiing has adapted, and their amazing versatility demonstrates that dedicated athletes don’t need perfect conditions to thrive. The absence of snow hasn't slowed them down; instead, the skiers focus on what they can control, turning the campus into their training ground. During the preseason—which lasts until the team has regular snow at Blue Hills around January—Varsity Skiing athletes gather four days a week not on the slopes, but across campus for workouts dubbed “drylands.” These are, essentially, just fitness off the slopes. Between workouts, the team has regular team meetings where they grow bonds, set expectations, and strategize. Skier Dylan Cafferty ‘27 shared his feelings about the time the skiers spend on dry land. “Sharing insights and advice,” Cafferty said, “[is super helpful] for younger or less experienced members, even off the hill.” His observation captures the team's approach to growth and improvement. The “dryland” period turns out to be more than just killing time until snowfall. “We try to mix in an assortment of team-building activities and workouts,\" Henry Ladd '25, Varsity Skiing captain, explained. In this way, he continued, they add a hint of fun to the serious business of training. Whether they're meeting in classrooms to study race footage or to exercise outside, these athletes know that getting better at skiing doesn't always require snow. In many ways, the skiers’ preseason training is unusual. Not only do they complete difficult workouts that could tire even the most fit athletes, but also they have a unique focus on team bonding, regularly playing games like ultimate frisbee to strengthen communication and bonds. \"The most important part of the pre-season is the team bonding,\" Cafferty pointed out, stressing the importance of the team’s balancing work and play—especially, he highlighted, after last year’s immense success. With their 2024 NEPSAC championship still fresh in their minds, the pressure to perform is real. Looking ahead, the team keeps their goals straightforward but ambitious. \"Coming off our NEPSAC win, I think the team will stay strong this year,\" Cafferty shared, his words carrying the casual confidence of someone who knows good preparation pays off. Last year's close call in the ISL just adds extra motivation to their daily workouts. \"Our first race of the season is on the [first] Wednesday [after returning] from Winter Break, which means we have one on-snow practice as a team before we compete,\" Ladd mentioned. His tone suggested not nervousness, but anticipation of another challenge to tackle. These athletes show up every day, making the best of what they have. Whether they're working on strength in the weight room or playing team-building games on the Quad, Milton's ski team proves that success comes from more than just snow time. They're building something special here - not just a team that can ski fast, but one that knows how to turn challenges into opportunities. Through morning workouts and afternoon strategy sessions, they're writing their own playbook for success. They aren't just waiting for snow - they're getting ready to show that preparation beats ideal conditions any day. As Winter Break approaches, one can spot the skiers around campus doing core workouts by the ACC or running drills on the Quad. The younger athletes watch the veterans, picking up not just techniques but determined, hardworking attitudes that will serve them well beyond this season. Maybe that's the real victory here—Varsity Skiing builds not just better skiers, but better teammates, regardless of what the weather brings."

      "title": "Athletes Maximize their Off-Seasons",
      "author": "Jai Malhotra ‘26 Sports Writer",
      "text": "One might think that after enduring a long and exhausting season playing a sport, athletes look forward to taking a break during the next months; the reality is that in most cases, relaxation is not at the top of players’ minds. It turns out that many Milton athletes use the “off-season” to train other aspects of their game. Of course, players continue to practice and develop their main sport skills during their time away from the field, course, or court, but many also use these winter months to cross-train, strategize, and build strength for gameplay next year. According to Steve Darling, head Strength and Conditioning coach, athletes should “engage in a well structured off-season athletic performance training program.” The program should include exercises and drills to improve overall “strength, speed, power, flexibility, cardio conditioning, etc.” For many athletes, the off-season means spending time in the weight room in order to build strength and fitness. Maddie Roskelly ‘27 shared that “[she] stay[s] active by running and working out on [her] own time four times a week.” Charlotte Weinstein ‘26 reported having a similar routine: “I try to go to the gym at least four days a week, and then some of the days that I don’t work out, I play tennis either with the wall or a coach.” Some athletes make their workouts more engaging and productive by involving others. As Cyrus Brun ‘27 explained, “a lot of the time I’m just playing something with friends in the ACC and doing friendly competitions to make [us all] better.” All three of these athletes share a commitment to maintaining their fitness and athleticism during the off-season through consistent training routines. Although conditioning is often seen as the most annoying part of athletic training, athletes recognize its importance and spend time building their endurance. Alden Goodman ‘26 practices this mindset. “Through the winter season,” Goodman said, “I try to build my stamina by going on runs every day… [which will] help me with climbing as well.” Goodman is not alone in using the off-season in this way. Teddy Choe ‘26 does “club track in the off-season to stay active. It helps [him] improve [his] performance for both the spring and fall seasons.” Like many others here, Goodman and Choe competed tirelessly through the fall season in their respective sports. While it may seem intuitive that the best way to excel in a sport is by devoting yourself to it, some of our best athletes actually use their “off” time to play another sport, which also improves their overall athleticism. Colin Lawrence ‘26 said “even though basketball isn’t my main sport, it helps me in many ways. It especially helps by making me faster, in better shape, and overall more athletic for football.” Lawrence’s winter training highlights how diversifying athletic activities can benefit one’s overall self. Darling, too, believes that “playing a different sport outside of your main sport season is a great way to cross-train. It helps decrease overuse injuries that someone would experience playing the same sport over and over again. It also helps you stay competitive and active each day, which will help both your physical and mental health.” Not all athletes focus solely on the physical aspect of training; many dedicate time to sharpening their minds. Hudson Li ‘26 shared that he “meditate[s] before basketball or volleyball games to quiet the voices in [his] head… so meditating [both in season and in the off season] and learning how to keep that doubtful or arrogant voice quiet has helped [him] become focused in sports and stay in a flow state.” In recognizing the importance of improving your mental game, and not just your physical abilities, Li is in great company. Tom Brady, former NFL quarterback, once said that “one of my biggest priorities was making sure I had the right mental toughness and attitude.” When one season ends, athletes spend their time away from the sport they love in a variety of ways, but it’s clear that there’s no true “off season” when it comes to being a competitive athlete. There is always some aspect of the game to improve, and there are many ways to get better. In the end, the effort put in during these months might just be what these athletes need to have a successful season. After all, according to Nick Saban, former college football coach for Alabama, “champions are made in the off season.”"

      "title": "Boys' Varsity Basketball Trains Recruits in \"Building Year\"",
      "author": "Dennis Zhou ‘27 Sports Writer",
      "text": "As the winter season approaches, Boys' Varsity Basketball finds itself in transition. Following the graduation of four starting players—who have now moved on to compete at the college level—the team is navigating a period of change and opportunity. With an increase in recruits this year, the squad is working to find a balance between the new talent and the established culture of the program. In previous seasons, the basketball team received few recruits, which made it easier for new players to learn about the team's play style as older and more experienced players shared the team's culture. This balance was crucial in maintaining team cohesion. This year, however, with the departure of the four seniors and the increased number of recruits replacing them, the team's focus has drastically shifted toward building chemistry and bonds. New recruit Connor Noel ‘27 shared how “incredibly” the team has welcomed him. He “appreciate[s] all the support [he’s] received and [the] emphasis on building the culture,” highlighting the team’s mini-golfing and escape room team-bonding activities as central to furthering a cohesive environment. Though a new player, Noel already “feel[s] at home with [his] teammates.” Player Cole Simmons ‘26 also commented on what the recruits could mean for the team, saying that their “bringing in a different kind of culture to the team will make it more difficult for [us] to work as smoothly as we did in previous years.” Although many fans might expect that the team will look and perform similar to last season, Simmons urged fans to be patient. Instead, he said, viewers should treat this season as “more of a growing year.” He felt it was important to note that, while the team might struggle at early points in the season due to the players’ lack of time to mesh, Boys’ Varsity Basketball still holds immense potential for a great season ahead. This year's recruits include three Class III students—Connor Noel ‘27, Ryan McLaughlin ‘27, and Spencer Booth ‘27—and one Class II student, Devan Williams ‘26. Each of these players have performed at high levels both in their club basketball and former highschool environments and are poised to recreate their success here at Milton. Simmons recognized that, despite these recruits’ not yet playing at the level of last year’s talented senior class, they “could [grow to be] as good if not better” than the graduated players. If Boys’ Varsity Basketball can maximize each player’s talent and create a strong team culture, captain Jack Watson ‘25 said “[the team] could be a NEPSAC championship contending squad.” Even with the departure of many key players, the returning players are still confident about the team’s potential. Simmons warned, “no one overlook us; we’re hungry for this,” speaking to the team's readiness to prove itself. From a coaching perspective, Boys’ Varsity Basketball Head Coach Lamar Reddicks mentioned that though having so many new players poses some challenges—for example, coaches have “to do a better job of explaining drills” because of a lack of continuity from previous years—the coaching staff ultimately “loves the challenge of getting [the] new players up to speed.” Reddicks continued, “watching them grow each day has been rewarding.” While he views this season as a developmental year, Watson believes that the team can still achieve great feats. Reddicks, too, cited a conversation he held with his team last week: every year, the program hopes to develop its players “to be stronger both mentally and physically,” but also to be “more knowledgeable and strengthened in character.” In short, basketball trains not just great athletes, but great teammates. The season ahead is unpredictable, but the players and fans are ready to embrace the journey ahead of them. With a mix of veteran leadership and youthful energy, the team is “ready to build its dynasty,” thinks Reece Marshall ‘27. The enthusiasm and dedication of the team make it clear that the players this year are hoping to set the foundation for a bright future, one that will inspire future generations of players and fans."

      "title": "SJSU Decision to Let Trans Athlete Play Volleyball Sparks Controversy",
      "author": "Ania Robinson ‘26 Sports Writer",
      "text": "Blaire Fleming, a volleyball player at San Jose State University, recently landed in controversy—not because of her skill or prowess, but because of her gender. Fleming, a transgender woman, has played volleyball at SJSU since 2022 after transfering from Coastal Carolina University. The Times of India notes that SJSU’s volleyball program is Division 1, and Fleming is second in this division in kills per set, leading her team in total kills. According to ESPN, “SJSU has said all of its players are eligible to compete on its women's volleyball team,” and that the NCAA has strict policies when it comes to allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports: “For volleyball, transgender women are deemed eligible if they suppress their testosterone under 10 nmol/L.” In addition, Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State, Nevada, and Southern Utah, forfeited their games against the San Jose State University women’s volleyball team, claiming Fleming’s spot on the roster as the reason. This situation has stirred up conversations on inclusion, fairness, and sportsmanship in college athletics and has raised critical questions: should Fleming, a transgender woman, be allowed to compete alongside and against women in college sports? And is it fair for teams to forfeit matches in protest? When asked whether or not Fleming should be allowed to play in NCAA women’s volleyball, two out of the seven interviewed Milton students gave a definite yes, four said yes but gave requisites, and one said absolutely not. All seven interviewees mentioned Fleming’s potential biological advantage and expressed negative emotions in response to the teams’ forfeiting; however, they each had their own unique perspective. Shu En Hsueh ‘28 said, “I think that everyone deserves to be able to play based on what they identify with…I don’t think it's fair [for teams to forfeit] because it's not good sportsmanship and also it [could make Fleming] feel dehumanized.” Meanwhile, Leo Demissie ‘25 took a firmer stance, declaring, “I think trans people should hold every right except to play in the gender sport that they feel more accurately aligns with their identity.” He argued that transgender athletes should play in the gender category they were assigned at birth. Demissie imparted a sentiment that the debate has become too divisive; however, he criticized the teams who forfeited, calling them “sore losers.” Katelyn Xue ‘26, a volleyball player herself, shared mixed feelings about Fleming’s playing. She expressed some discomfort about competing with someone who might have a biological advantage but ultimately stated, “play the game. It’s just fun. She’s on the other side of the net, she’s on the other team. Just play the game.” Nehemiah Sanon ‘26 stated, “I feel like I understand why other teams would [forfeit], but you have to think about that one person. That could crush her morale. It's rude, but I get why they do it.” He acknowledges that the volleyball teams have their own opinions and make their own decisions, but he also humanizes Fleming. Ariam Gebresilassie ‘25 brought up an interesting question. She wondered, “say there is a very buff person who is at the time identifying as a woman and born as a woman, [and] they’re dominating in their sport, like ten times better than anyone. Then, they transition, and they enter the men's league, and they’re dominating the male league. What then? Do you take out that person?” This remark invites us to consider how we define fairness in sports and whether the current systems, such as the NCAA, adequately account for individual differences and embrace skills while remaining fair. The debate surrounding Blaire Fleming accentuates the complexities of integrating transgender athletes into highly competitive sports. It highlights the tension between biological differences, identity, and the values of inclusion and fairness, and the decision to let Fleming play may set important precedents for the future of sports."

      "title": "Coco's Corner (Notes from 11/21 & 12/5)",
      "author": "Boarding Monitors - Chloe & David",
      "text": "Hi, everyone! First off, we want to thank you all for the opportunity to serve the boarding community and the SGA as your Boarding Monitors this year. We have been putting our best efforts into our work so far, and we don’t plan on slowing down! As of late, Boarder Dinner has been our biggest priority, and this year’s is about to be the best one yet, thanks to student suggestions. The menu we’ve brainstormed, which many of us boarders have confirmed is a massive step up from those in past years. Aramark really outdid themselves this year. You can also expect dazzling performances from several Acapella groups as usual. Of course, as per tradition, our winter jubilation will continue with caroling. While we have been working hard practicing in Goodwin and Hathaway, we can’t wait to see what the rest of the dorms come up with. Beyond boarder dinner, we, along with the rest of the Boarding Council, have brainstormed a plethora of potential ideas to follow during winter break. Here’s a sneak peek at some of the possibilities: Boba Night, the Return of the Waffle Truck, an Outdoor Cookout, and perhaps even an Upperclassman-Underclassman Sleepover. We are also super excited for the annual Dorm Dodgeball tournament to begin, soon after the start of the second semester. Again, we are extremely grateful for the chance to contribute to boarding life at Milton. If there are any questions, suggestions, or comments, please reach out to us! Boarding Monitors - Chloe & David. Notes from 11/21 & 12/5: Stu Redesign w/ Ms. Reiser: Discuss thoughts on how the stu redesign went and what we would change - this does not mean that action will be taken all of of these ideas, we are just brainstorming - The furniture in the underclassman section is more designed for relaxing but the upperclassmen section is more work-oriented - Get rid of the sophomore wall to open up the space and remove division - The redesign encourages everyone to sit together - Possibly move the printer upstairs and the computer locker elsewhere and replace with more couches - The help desk is not used - put in long couches that you can disassemble, like the ones in the RSG - Put square tables so that they fit together for larger groups More storage space Boarder Dinner - We discussed menu items we would love to see at boarder dinner and other aspects of the event with Ms. Butler Segmented Work -Talk about what each pair has been up to! Here are some highlighted achievements - The juniors are teeing up a grade- wide Secret Santa - The sophomores are almost finished with their class merch - look out for an incoming form - The seniors had lower school students make cards for the seniors before the November 1st college application deadline :) and they are starting to manage the budget for the senior trip - The day monitors are working to better communicate the late policy The head monitors are working on some fun holiday excitement for the last week of school - 4 days of holiday! Math Club Problem of the Week Problem 1211 (Session 2, Week 4): In the song, “12 Days of Christmas”, my true love gives me gifts for twelve straight days. How thoughtful. How many things do I receive overall across the 12 days, according to the song? Submit your answers (and thinking!) here:"
